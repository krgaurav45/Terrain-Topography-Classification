# Terrain-Topography-Classification
### Image Scene Classification of Multiclass

### 1. Context
This is image data of Natural Scenes and various geographical location either natural or man-made around the world. Our task is to build powerful Neural network that can classify these images with more accuracy.

### 2. Content
1. This Data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories.
2. This is a multiclass problem, where we will try to find class of the given image from these mentioned six classes. 
3. Classes:- {'buildings' -> 0,'forest' -> 1,'glacier' -> 2,'mountain' -> 3,'sea' -> 4,'street' -> 5 }


-> The Train, Test and Prediction data is separated in each zip files. There are around 14k images in Train, 3k in Test and 7k in Prediction.
-> This data was initially published on https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com by Intel to host a Image classification Challenge.
