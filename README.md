# Terrain-Topography-Classification
### Image Scene Classification of Multiclass

### Context
This is image data of Natural Scenes and various geographical location either natural or man-made around the world. Our task is to build powerful Neural network that can classify these images with more accuracy.

### Content
This Data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories.
This is a multiclass problem, where we will try to find class of the given image from these mentioned six classes. 
{'buildings' -> 0,
'forest' -> 1,
'glacier' -> 2,
'mountain' -> 3,
'sea' -> 4,
'street' -> 5 }

The Train, Test and Prediction data is separated in each zip files. There are around 14k images in Train, 3k in Test and 7k in Prediction.
This data was initially published on https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com by Intel to host a Image classification Challenge.
